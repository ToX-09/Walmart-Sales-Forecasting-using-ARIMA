# üõí Walmart Sales Forecasting using ARIMA

This project forecasts weekly sales for Walmart stores using classical time series modeling with **ARIMA**. It focuses on a granular level: individual `Store` and `Department` combinations, specifically `Store 1 - Dept 1`. Forecasts like these help businesses optimize inventory, reduce stockouts, and enhance planning accuracy.

## üìä Problem Statement

Retailers like Walmart need to forecast product sales weekly to:
- Maintain optimal inventory levels
- Prevent overstock and understock situations
- Reduce holding costs and improve supply chain efficiency

---

## üß† Approach

This project uses the **ARIMA(1,1,1)** model for univariate time series forecasting. Here's the step-by-step approach:

- üì¶ **Data Merging**: Combined sales, store, and feature datasets.
- üìà **EDA**: Trends, seasonality, holiday impact, and outliers.
- üß™ **Stationarity Check**: ADF Test + First-order differencing.
- üîÅ **ACF & PACF**: Determine ARIMA parameters.
- üìâ **Model Training**: ARIMA(1,1,1) on training set.
- üìä **Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on 12-week test set.

## üìÇ Dataset

Source: [Kaggle - Walmart Store Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

Files used:
- `train.csv`: Weekly sales per Store/Dept
- `features.csv`: Temperature, Fuel Prices, Holidays, CPI, Unemployment
- `stores.csv`: Store Type & Size metadata

---

## üìå Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MAE    | 2943.68 |
| RMSE   | 3302.16 |
| MAPE   | 13.67% |

‚úÖ The model performs with a reasonably low error, especially considering sales volatility across departments and holiday spikes.
